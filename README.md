UNITE


Due to increased number of social media platforms , everything remains scattered . The colleges do not have a common place where all the college specific activities happen . We cannot see the working of all clubs. Publicity of events always remains a tough task. Class representatives always remain engaged in forwarding messages from one place to another. There is no content discussion place except personal messaging.

announcements.

•Technology Used: React-Js, MySql, Javascript, Supabase

•Designed profile page, authentication and chatting interface for webapp.

• Designed database, developed CRUD operations for posts, designed APIs for fetching data/images from 
Cloud and authentication on   college email-ids.

• Reduced overhead of 5 hours per week on society heads that went in keeping tracks of various groups.
